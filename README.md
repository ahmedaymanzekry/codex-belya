Belya is a traditional Egyptian term used for an assistant working at an auto repair shop. He helps the master mechanic and organize the shop for him.
That's what Codex-Belya is. It serves as an AI voice assistant for Codex; helping you "talk" to your code (which all of us do when we are in the zone) and assign tasks to Codex, while focusing on the nitty gritty review and enhancement.
It let's you organize and communicate your thoughts to assign Codex on it, while you go and focus on formulating the next set of goals.
